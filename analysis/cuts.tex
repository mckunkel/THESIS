\section{Fiducial Cuts}\label{sec:analysis.data.reduction}
This section will describe the various detector performance cuts that were used in this analysis to clean the data due to various subsystems deficiencies. These deficiencies are not understood well enough to be modeled in the \abbr{MC}, therefore some events must be removed from the analysis.
