\subsection{\abbr{TOF} Fiducial Cuts}\label{sec:analysis.tof_fid}

The efficiency for the \abbr{TOF} subsystem, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.tof}, is different for each paddle for each section. As a result, there are regions of detection in which are inefficient. The program \abbr{GPP}, Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.simulation}, was constructed to account for these inefficiencies in the simulation. However the \abbr{MC} indicated a greater efficiency than we measured in the data. Therefore we measured the efficiency of \abbr{CLAS} as a function of particle angle and momentum. The particles $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$ and proton momentum and angular measurements were selected from data and \abbr{MC} to analyze these functions. When an inefficiency was observed in the data, but not the \abbr{MC}, equations were derived in $\theta$ and $\phi$ to use as a cut to account for the inefficiency. Example of such an inefficiency can be seen in Fig~\ref{fig:pos:tofcut_off}, where the top panel depicts the $\pi^+$ azimuthal angle~($\phi$) vs. polar angle~($\theta$) and the bottom panel illustrates momentum~($p$) vs. polar angle~($\theta$) for sector 3.

%At the time of writing this manuscript, there was no reliable hypothesis for dealing with the \abbr{TOF} at the \abbr{TOF} subsystem level or \abbr{TOF} paddle level.
Fig.~\ref{fig:pos:tofcut_off} shows a band of low efficiency pertaining to a inefficient \abbr{TOF} paddle between$\approx 15^\circ < \theta < 21^\circ$. Fig.~\ref{fig:pos:tofcut_off} also shows a ``rib" like structure on the bottom plot, $\theta$ vs. $p$, which is not present in the $\pi^-$ data, therefore was not further investigated as a bad paddle. The inefficient section of sector 3 was removed in data and \abbr{MC}. The effect of this cut can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:pos:tofcut_on}. The statistical sample used in Fig.~\ref{fig:pos:tofcut_on} was $1/5$ of the data used to derive the cut equation shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pos:tofcut_off}. There also existed an inefficiency in sector 1. The plots showing the inefficiency along with the other 5 sectors can be found in App.~\ref{sec:app.tof_plots}. The parameters for the \abbr{TOF} cuts are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:tof.eq}. Placing the cuts described in Tab.~\ref{tab:tof.eq} is equivalent to knocking out \abbr{TOF} paddle by ID number. The variable $\phi_s$ is $\phi$ represented in the interval of $-30\le \phi \le30$ in which the term $f_{mod}$ is the $C++$ function used to perform the operation.
