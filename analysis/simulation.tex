\section{Simulation}\label{sec:analysis.simulation}
There are certain kinematic regions of \abbr{CLAS} in which physics events are not being recorded properly i.e.~the area dividing each sector in \abbr{CLAS}. Furthermore each sector in \abbr{CLAS} is asymmetric in the acceptance of events due to subsystem inefficiencies such as inoperable \abbr{DC} wires, \abbr{PMT} inefficiencies, dead scintillator strips the the \abbr{TOF} and \abbr{ST} subsystems. When a triggered event is recorded and reconstructed these asymmetric inefficiencies factors are reflected and must be carefully understood because these factors are properties of the \abbr{CLAS} detector and independent of any physics that occurred. To properly understand the detector effects on the data, \abbr{CLAS} utilizes a \abbr{GEANT} simulation package know as \abbr{GSIM}. To prepare an event for \abbr{GSIM} the program \abbr{GAMP2PART} converts a text file, containing the 4-momentum of the generated event, into a suitable file format for \abbr{GSIM}. \abbr{GSIM} then simulates the passage of these particles through the \abbr{CLAS} detector and generates the associated \abbr{ADC} and \abbr{TDC} information from detector hits. \abbr{GSIM} takes into account detector inefficiencies described in the \abbr{\texttt{CLAS\_CALDB\_RUNINDEX}}. The \abbr{CLAS\_CALDB\_RUNINDEX} is an array of information about each subsystem's inefficiency that was derived during the \g12 calibration process. The \abbr{GSIM} simulated hits are then ``post-processed'' by smearing the \abbr{TDC} and \abbr{ADC} hits to imitate the observed resolution of the detector subsystems using the program \abbr{GPP} (\abbr{GSIM} post-processor). \abbr{GPP} also removes detector hits due to inefficient \abbr{DC} wires. The simulation output processed with \abbr{GPP} is then reconstructed with \texttt{a1c}, the same program used to reconstruct data events. The reconstructed simulation is subject to the same scrutiny as real data events, undergoing all the cuts (Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.data.reduction}), corrections (Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.corrections}), and kinematic fitting (Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.fitting}), as the real data except for beam corrections (Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.corrections.beam}).
