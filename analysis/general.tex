\section{General Features of Lepton Data in \g12}\label{sec:analysis.Lepton.general}

Electron and positron energy deposition while propagating through a material was briefly explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.cc} and ~\ref{sec:clas.ec}. To identify electrons and positrons properly in \abbr{CLAS}, quantities obtained from the \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} are used to reject charged pions. The \abbr{CC} collects the number of photo-electrons caused by Cherenkov radiation and the \abbr{EC} records the energy deposition of electrons/positrons as well as photons. A previous \abbr{CLAS} experiment \emph{g7} analyzed the properties of medium modifications from the decay of vector mesons through the leptonic decay channel. This experiment derived a set of cits for identifying electron/positrons pairs in \abbr{CLAS} by employing specific cuts to the number of photo-electrons (\abbr{NPE}) detected in the \abbr{CC}, a match in azimuthal angle $\phi$ from a charged track in the \abbr{DC} to the $\phi$ of the \abbr{CC}, as well as comparing the momentum of the charged track to the energy deposited in the \abbr{EC}. These cuts can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ISLEP_cuts}.  
\input{tables/islep}
To validate the \emph{g7} electron/positron \abbr{PID} scheme for \g12, a comparison of  the \abbr{CC} and \abbr{EC} quantities was performed for all charged tracks \abbr{CC}/\abbr{EC} hit signatures and while selecting events from \piz decay. To separate the \piz events from the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ events, all charged pions were assigned the mass of electrons and cuts were placed on the missing energy of $\gamma p \rightarrow p e^+ e^-$ as well as a cut on the missing mass squared of $\gamma p \rightarrow p$, values found in Table~\ref{tab:lep_cuts}. A graphical depiction of the cuts applied to separate \piz events from the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ events is seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:islep.cuts}.
\input{tables/lepPIDcuts} 
The values of the threshold momentum are calculated from empirical studies and are based upon calculations using the momentum obtained from the \abbr{DC }$p$ under the following criteria;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{p_{thres}^{low}} = \alpha p *(p+EC_{P\_LO})/p \nonumber \\
\mathrm{p_{thres}^{high}} = \alpha p *(p+EC_{P\_HIGH})/p \nonumber
\end{align}
where $EC_{P\_LO} = -0.3$, $EC_{P\_HIGH} = 0.5$ and  
\begin{align}
\alpha p =
\begin{cases}
.23*p + .071p^2 - .032p^3, & p<1.0 \mathrm{~GeV} \\
0.272p, & p>1.0 \mathrm{~GeV} \\
\end{cases}\nonumber
\end{align}

\subsubsection{\abbr{CC} Comparison}

The \abbr{NPE} measured by the \abbr{CC} for all positron/electron (e$^+$/e$^-$) candidates can be seen in Fig~\ref{fig:islep.CC}. The sharp decline prior to 2.5 \abbr{NPE} is due to photo-electrons created by electron/positrons, pions traveling through the \abbr{CC} or pions producing delta-electrons which pass through the \abbr{CC}. Delta-electrons are created as an effect of the ionization of gases that could be present when the pion travels through the \abbr{DC}. These types of electrons are typically lower in momentum than the electrons obtained from particle decays in \abbr{CLAS} and thus according to eq.~\ref{eq:cc.NPE} should emit less \abbr{NPE} per unit length.

Through mass conservation, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis.pid}, the particles in the \piz events must be e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs. In comparison to fig.~\ref{fig:islep.CC}, fig.~\ref{fig:islep.CC1} plots the \abbr{NPE} measured by the \abbr{CC} for all e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs for \piz events selected as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:islep.cuts}. It can be seen that the sharp decline prior to \abbr{NPE} = 2.5 is reduced leaving mostly electrons or positrons signatures in the \abbr{CC} concluding that the \emph{g7} \abbr{CC} \abbr{NPE} cut is valid for identifying e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs while rejecting $\pi^+$/$\pi^-$ pairs.

Similarly to the \abbr{CC} comparison, figures~\ref{fig:islep.pimEClow},~\ref{fig:islep.pimEChigh},~\ref{fig:islep.pipEClow},~\ref{fig:islep.pipEChigh} depict the  p$\mathrm{_{thres}^{low}}$ and  p$\mathrm{_{thres}^{low}}$ cuts listed in  Table~\ref{tab:ISLEP_cuts} for the q$^-$ and q$^+$ tracks respectively. After \piz event selection, seen in figures~\ref{fig:islep.pimEC},~\ref{fig:islep.pimECcut} ,~\ref{fig:islep.pipEC} ,~\ref{fig:islep.pipECcut}, the bulk of e$^+$/e$^-$ events reside within the region of the cut acceptance therefore it is evident that the \emph{g7} \abbr{EC} cuts are valid for identifying e$^+$/e$^-$ pairs. The following four plots are for electron($e^-$) \abbr{PID} validation of the \emph{g7} \abbr{EC} cuts described in Table~\ref{tab:ISLEP_cuts}.
