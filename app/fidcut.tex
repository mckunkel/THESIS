\chapter{\label{sec:app.fidcut}Fiducial Cuts}

The fiducial cut applied to all tracks in this analysis were done so that only the geometric regions where the \abbr{MC} is reliable were considered. The cuts were based on the charge and the momentum angles, $\theta$ and $\phi$, for each track in the lab-frame. The azimuthal angle ($\phi$) was the absolute value from the center of each \abbr{CLAS} sector. The shape of the cut, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fidcut.diagram}, consists of a minimum $\phi$, a paraboolic curve in ($\phi$, $\theta$) and finally a maximum absolute value $|\theta|$.
