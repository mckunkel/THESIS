\chapter{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

Let talk about reconstruction of events, simulation and all other this chapter will discuss

%The analysis of \abbr{CLAS} data begins with reconstructed events (see Sec.~\ref{sec:data.cook}), the essential parts of which are the identified particle and its momentum. The rudimentary particle identification schemes associated with the reconstruction program (\abbr{a1c}) are extremely loose for most kaon analyses. That is, more than half the tracks labeled as kaons are in fact misidentified pions and this is the primary source of background ``noise'' in kaon analyses done with \abbr{CLAS}. However, it is a good starting point for the analysis that follows, and virtually all event selections criteria are chosen so as to minimize this pion-contamination without destroying the targeted resonances.
%
%The first step of this analysis identifies the beam photon that triggered the event. All the tracks are then matched to this photon and out-of-time tracks are thrown out. The particles are identified based on their momentum measured in the \abbr{DC} and speed obtained from the \abbr{TOF}. The energy of each is then recalculated using the mass of the particle as found in the literature. With the four-momenta of the tracks in hand, the data are explored for resonances, cross sections and other trends. These steps are described in detail in the next few sections as a setup for the final results presented in the following chapter which include the excitation function for the photoproduction of the $\Xi^-$(1320) and $\Xi^-$(1530) as well as total cross section upper limits of higher-mass cascades and iso-exotic states.
