\section{Beam Positioning}\label{sec:clas.beam}
%\FloatBarrier
There are several beam monitoring stations in Hall \desg{B} before and after the \abbr{CLAS} detector (Fig.~\ref{fig:clas.beam.beforemonitors}) to scan the important details of the electron beam prior to conversion into a photon beam and the details of the photon beam before and after entering the target. Such quantities for the electron beam include position, intensity, dispersion, and current, and for the photon beam include position, dispersion and flux. Most of these monitoring stations are used by the accelerator group.

There are two types of devices to measure the electron beam position. The first type is represented by two beam position monitors (\abbr{BPM}s\label{abbr:bpm}) placed before the tagger. The position monitors use three radiofrequency cavities to measure the transverse location of the electron beam and its intensity. This information is used as feedback for the steering mechanism. The position monitors are noninvasive and measure at a rate of 1 Hz. 
The second type of device used to measure the beam position is the Harp Beam Profile Monitor, which also measures the electron beam dispersion. The harp devices consist of fine wires (20 and 50~{\um} W and 100~{\um} Fe) that can be passed through the beam at specific orientations and collect scattered electrons with a photomultiplier tube. This procedure measures the horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) profile of the electron beam and is performed after any downtime or change in the beam. The accelerator group adjusts the beam position such that more than 99\% of the electron beam goes through the radiator. Since this process is invasive, it was only done when the drift-chambers and \abbr{DAQ} were turned off. A harp scan measurement for \g12 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:clas.beam.harpscan}. The width of the beam was contained within a 200 $\mathrm{\mu}$m diameter.

The Total Absorption Shower Counter located downstream of \abbr{CLAS}, measures the photon flux (see Fig.~\ref{fig:clas.beam.afterCLAS}). The \abbr{TASC}, consists of four lead glass blocks of $\sim$ 17 radiation lengths, each coupled to a photo-multiplier tube (\abbr{PMT}\label{abbr:pmt}). The \abbr{TASC} is approximately 100\% efficient at detecting photons at beam currents less than 100~pA\cite{clas.tagger,clas.tagger.calib}. Since \g12 ran with 65~nA current, special low current, 50~pA, normalization runs(see Table~\ref{tab:data.calibruns}) were taken several times throughout \g12. The ratio of electrons detected in the photon tagger (see Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.tagr}) to that of photons detected in the \abbr{TASC} gives the tagging ratio used to calibrate the tagger and measure the flux throughout the entire \g12 run period.
