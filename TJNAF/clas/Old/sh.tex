\section{\label{sec:clas.sh}Scintillator Hodoscope (\abbr{SH})}

\todo{NOTE: This section might have to wait (or be cut) untill we actually start using the SH.}

New to \abbr{CLAS}, and installed after the second week of running \g12, was a scintillator hodoscope (\abbr{SH}) placed a few centimeters downstream of the target. This consisted of square ``pixels'' which were read out via silicone photo-counters (\abbr{ScPMC}). This was added in anticipation of the following runs which would use it as a veto counter for the inner calorimeter.
