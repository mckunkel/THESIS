\section{Drift Chambers}\label{sec:clas.dc}

Explain \abbr{DC}
%The primary subsystem of the \abbr{CLAS} detector is a collection of multi-wire proportional drift-chambers\cite{clas.dc} (\abbr{DC}) consisting of three layers in each of six sectors as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:clas}. There is a toroidal magnetic field encompassing the middle layer which causes the charged particles to bend either directly toward or away from the beam-line. The magnetic field at regions 1 and 3 (inner and outer layers respectively) is relatively weak compared to region 2 as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:clas.dc.torus.mag}. Therefore, the bending of the tracks is concentrated inside region 2 of the \abbr{DC} and the charge and momenta of the particles are determined by measuring the deflection angle of the tracks.

For \g12, the direction of the field was into the page and the 40~cm target center was placed at $-90$~cm from the \abbr{CLAS} center. Region 2 of the \abbr{DC} is located inside the region of the coils shown as the kidney shaped loop at about 3~kG.}

%Each region of the \abbr{DC} consists of two \emph{superlayers} which contain six layers of evenly spaced 20~$\mu$m gold-plated tungsten \emph{sense wires} each surrounded by six 140~$\mu$m gold-plated aluminum alloy \emph{field wires}. The very first superlayer (region 1, superlayer 1) has only 4 layers due to space constraints. The field wires were kept at a high negative voltage (approximately $-1.5$~kV) while the sense wires were kept at a moderate positive voltage.
%
%The gas used in the \abbr{DC} is 90\% argon and 10\% carbon-dioxide which is a non-flammable mixture that ionizes easily when charged particles above a certain energy pass through it. The ionized electrons cascade and drift toward the sense wires creating a signal that is amplified and passed through amplifier-discriminator boards (\abbr{ADB}s) and recorded by time-to-digital converters (\abbr{TDC}s). Due to budget considerations, there were no analog-to-digital (\abbr{ADC}) signals recorded from the \abbr{DC}. This could have provided information on the particles' energy loss as it traveled through the chambers, however, energy loss through other systems such as the \abbr{TOF} was available and used in this analysis, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:analysis}.
