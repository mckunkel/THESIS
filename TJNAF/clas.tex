\section{CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)} \label{sec:tjnaf.clas}

The \abbr{CLAS} detector, shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:clas}, ~\ref{fig:clas.ced}, is assembled of four types of detectors, five detectors total,  that are arranged in an onion like pattern (around the beam line) covering $\sim 3\pi$ with a diameter of 8~m. Each layer is segmented such that there are six segments around $\phi$ (angle about the beam line), called sectors, each with a polar coverage, $\theta$ (angle from beam line), of approximately $\frac{3}{4}\pi$~radians. Each sector consists of a scintillator start counter (\abbr{ST}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.st}, three layers of drift chambers (\abbr{DC}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.dc}, a layer of scintillator ``time-of-flight'' counters (\abbr{TOF}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.tof}, a gas Cherenkov counter (\abbr{CC}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.cc} and an electromagnetic calorimeter (\abbr{EC}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.ec}. There is a toroidal magnetic field generated by six superconducting coils that divide the sectors. The direction of the toroidal field is azimuthal, $\phi$ (angle about the beam line), such that the charged particles conserve their azimuthal angle along their trajectory, except near the coils. The magnetic field geometry guides the particles which allows for a simplified reconstruction algorithm to determine the particles' momenta, see Eq.~\ref{eq:motioninmag}. This section will discuss the subsystems in more detail.
% This field however produces an asymmetry in the acceptance of oppositely charged particles.
