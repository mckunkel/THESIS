\section{CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)} \label{sec:tjnaf.clas}

The \abbr{CLAS} detector, shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:clas.beam.aftermonitors}, \ref{fig:clas} and \ref{fig:clas.ced}, is assembled of four types of detectors, five detectors total,  that are arranged in an onion like pattern (angle around the beam line) covering $\sim 3\pi$ with a diameter of 8m. Each layer is segmented such that there are six segments around $\phi$ (angle about the beam line), called sectors, each of with a polar coverage, $\theta$ (angle from beam line), of approximately $\frac{3}{4}\pi$~radians. Each sector consists of a scintillator start counter (\abbr{ST}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.st}, three layers of drift chambers (\abbr{DC}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.dc}, a series of scintillator ``time-of-flight'' counters (\abbr{TOF}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.tof}, a gas Cherenkov counter (\abbr{CC}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.cc} and an electromagnetic calorimeter (\abbr{EC}) Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.ec}. There is a toroidal magnetic field generated by six superconducting coils that are placed dividing each sector. The direction of the toroidal field has azimuthal coverage, $\phi$ (angle about the beam line), such that the charged particles conserve their azimuthal angle along their trajectory, except near the coils. The magnetic field geometry guides the particles to trace a path lying on a plane, see equation~\ref{eq:motioninmag}, which allows for a simplified reconstruction algorithm to determine the particles' momenta. This field however produces an asymmetry in the acceptance of oppositely charged particles. This section will discuss the subsystems in more detail.

%The CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) was used to detect particles produced by interactions of the photon beam with the cryogenic target located near the center of the CLAS de- tector. The main CLAS subsystems are the start counter, drift chambers, time-of-flight scintillators, along with Cerenkov counters and electromagnetic calorimeters in the forward region. The latter two forward region detector elements were not used in our analysis and will not be discussed here. Our analysis did not incorporate the start counter; however, it was used in the g11a trigger. The drift chambers were used to track charged particles, which were bent by a superconducting toroidal magnetic, as they traveled through the detector. By reconstructing a particle’s flight path, we were able to determine its momentum. The time-of-flight scintillator walls were used for particle identifi- cation purposes. In this section, we will discuss in detail the detector subsystems which played vital roles in our analysis.



%In Hall \desg{B} of \abbr{JLab}, the \abbr{CEBAF} Large Angle Spectrometer (\abbr{CLAS}\label{abbr:clas}) is, in essence, a large acceptance multi-wire proportional drift-chamber (\abbr{DC}). The main purpose of the \abbr{DC} in conjunction with the toroidal magnetic field (see Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.dc}) is to measure the momentum of charged final-state particles that leave the target. For the most part, the rest of the \abbr{CLAS} detector is used to obtain accurate timing and particle identification. In particular, a photon tagger, specific to Hall \desg{B} \emph{photon runs} as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.tagr}, is used to measure the energy of photons incident on the target. In addition, there are several beam intensity and dispersion measuring devices used as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.beam}.


%The physics program at \abbr{CLAS} investigates many aspects of nuclear and particle physics including but not limited to, transition form factors, medium modifications of meson propagation, short-range correlations in the nuclear medium, spin structure of the nucleon and spectroscopy of excited states. To study such mentioned physics with high statistical sensitivity and high detection efficiency, a large acceptance detector is required.

%The design of CLAS is based on a toroidal magnetic field generated by six superconducting coils made of niobium titanium alloy (NbTi) kept at 4.5 K by a recirculating helium flow. The direction of the toroidal field points along $\phi$ such that the charged particles conserve their azimuthal angle along their trajectory, except near the coils, which lies in the plane containing the beam axis. The kidney shape of the magnet was designed to provide a strong field gradient for the forward going particles carrying high momentum and a lower field gradient for particles emitted at larger angles (Fig. 2.3). At the maximum current of 3860 A the integral magnetic field reaches 2.5 T·m in the forward direction, dropping to 0.6 T·m at a scattering angle of 90◦. Another magnet used in CLAS is mini torus. Placed between the target and the first region of drift chambers, it reduces the background produced by scattered Moller electrons.

%The six coils separate CLAS naturally into six independent tracking areas (or sectors). The particle leaving the target crosses (Fig. 2.2) three regions of drift chambers (DC) which provide a measurement of a charged particle trajectory in the toroidal field, Cˇerenkov counters (CC) provide identification and separation of particles carrying the same charge, scintillator counters which measure the time of flight (TOF), and finally the electromagnetic calorimeters (EC) measures energy and enables detection of neutral particles.
