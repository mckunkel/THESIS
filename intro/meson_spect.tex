\subsection{Meson Spectroscopy}\label{sec:intro.spect}
Meson spectroscopy is a comprehensive subfield of particle physics that is dedicated to the study of the mass spectrum and the quantum numbers of mesons. Meson spectroscopy also studies mesons decay channels, decay widths, production mechanisms and other physical attributes. Meson spectroscopy's goal is to gain insight into \abbr{QCD} and its interactions though mentioned measurements forming a firmer experimental and theoretical grounds on known and unknown physics and phenomena.
