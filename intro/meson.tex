\section{Hadrons}
In the quark model, a hadron is a colorless particle formed of quarks and anti-quarks that are bound together by the strong force. Hadrons are organized and classified according to their quark content. The standard model permits multiple valence quark configurations for hadrons, however to date only two configurations have been verified, baryons and mesons. Baryons are hadrons with three quarks with suitable colors, while hadrons with two valence quarks, a quark and an anti-quark with color and ``anti-color'', are called mesons. Since baryons have an odd number of valence quarks, they are spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles and thus are fermions, however mesons are spin 0 or 1 particles are bosons. As in any quantum-mechanical bound system, the valence quarks have a discrete energy level spectrum due to the various modes of the di-quark excitations, vibrations, orientations and vibrations which give rise to the quantum numbers $J^{PC}$. Here $J=L+S$ is defined as the total angular momentum containing orbital angular momentum $L$ and spin $S$, while $P=(-1)^{L+1}$ and $C= (-1)^{L+S}$ are defined as parity and charge conjugation.

%The valence quarks in hadrons produce the quantum numbers $J^{PC}$, where $J=L+S$ is the total angular momentum created by the orbital angular momentum, L,  and the spin, S, of the particle. The ``P" stands for parity, $P = (-1)^{L+1}$, and ``C" is the charge conjugation, $C = (-1)^{L+S}$. Each type of meson can be categorized by their spin configuration and are shown in table 1 below.

%In the quark model, mesons are comprised of two valence quarks which are a quark and an anti-quark with color and ``anti-color''. Since mesons are comprised of a quark-antiquark pair, they are bosons. 
%These various modes give rise to the quantum numbers of the mesons via their flavor and symmetry $J^{PC}$.
%The different mesons can be classified into types according to their spin configurations. 
Each type of meson can be categorized by their spin configuration and are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:meson_type}.
