\section{\piz Production} \label{sec:into:xsection}
The present analysis uses two approaches to describe the behavior of the \piz cross-section. One approach is for incident photon beam energies less than 2.8~GeV where the missing resonance search is most valid and the data can be described well by coupling of the \piz electromagnetic wave functions. The second approach attempts to describe the behavior of the \piz by using General Parton Distribution models, \abbr{GPD} for incident photon beam energies greater than 2.8~GeV.
%The physics behind this is that since the photon couples to charged-fermion pairs, a part of its cross-section could be described by considering interactions between the hadron and a virtual fermion pair~\cite{butterworth}.
