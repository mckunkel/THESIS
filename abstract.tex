Photoproduction of the $\pi^0$ meson was studied using the \textsc{\texttt{CLAS}} detector at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility for incident beam energies from 1.1~GeV to 5.45~GeV. We report the measurement of the $\pi^0$ differential cross sections $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$ and $\frac{d\sigma}{dt}$. The angular distributions agree well with the SAID parametrization for incident beam energies below 3~GeV, while for an interpretation of the data within the handbag model is discussed for incident beam energies greater than 3~GeV. The measurement is performed on a liquid hydrogen target in the reaction $\gamma p\to pe^+e^-(\gamma)$ using a tagged photon beam. In the final state of the reaction the Dalitz decay mode and conversion mode are studied, where the final state photon is missing, $p$, $e^+$ and $e^-$ are detected. The $\pi^0$ meson is identified through the missing mass of proton.
