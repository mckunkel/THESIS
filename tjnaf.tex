\chapter{The CLAS detector at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility }\label{sec:clas}

The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (\abbr{TJNAF}\label{abbr:tjnaf}, Fig.~\ref{fig:jlab.aerial}), also known as Jefferson Laboratory (\abbr{JLab}\label{abbr:jlab}) is located in Newport News, Virgina. It is one of 17 national laboratories funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and is home to three experimental halls, \desg{A}, \desg{B}, \desg{C}, and the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility,\cite{cebaf} (\abbr{CEBAF}\label{abbr:cebaf}, Fig.~\ref{fig:jlab.cebaf}).

\abbr{JLab}'s stated mission is ``to provide forefront scientific facilities, opportunities and leadership essential for discovering the fundamental structure of nuclear matter; to partner in industry to apply its advanced technology; and to serve the nation and its communities through education and public outreach."\cite{Jlabwiki} In addition to its science mission, the lab provides programs designed to help educate the next generation in science and technology, and to engage the public.
%\abbr{JLab} also conducts a variety of research using its Free-Electron Laser, which is based on the same electron-accelerating technology used in \abbr{CEBAF}.

The analysis performed in this work utilizes experimental data collected with the \abbr{CEBAF} Large Acceptance Spectrometer (\abbr{CLAS}) in hall \desg{B}, using \abbr{CEBAF}. The experiment \g12 collected over 126~TB of raw data in 44 days of beam time from April to June 2008, making \g12 the world's largest multi-particle dataset in the energy range 1.77 GeV $\mathrm{< \sqrt{s} <}$ 3.33 GeV. This chaper is dedicated to the explanation of \abbr{CEBAF}, \abbr{CLAS} and other subsystems used during the \g12 run period.
