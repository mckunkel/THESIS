\subsection{\label{sec:results.xi1320.xfn}Excitation Function}

The flux-corrected measured yield divided by the acceptance is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:xim1320.xfn} as the final excitation function of the ground state $\Xi^-$(1320). The error bars indicate the statistical error only and the systematic error is estimated to be approximately 8\%.

Shown are the data with selections described in Tables~\ref{tab:vtime.cuts} and \ref{tab:kpkp.cuts} with and without the \abbr{TOF} energy deposit cut. The plot on the right has the added requirement of an in-time proton.}
