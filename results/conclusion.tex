\section{Comparison to World Data and SAID Fits}\label{sec:results.conclusion}
This section will discuss comparisons of our data with SAID fits and the \abbr{GPD} handbag model. The SAID parameterization, discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro.said}, for this analysis was based upon previous data observables in conjunction with the new cross-section measurement presented in this analysis.

\subsection{Improvement to Previous SAID Fits}
\subsubsection{CGLN Amplitudes}
To demonstrate the impact of our data on the global fit, in Fig.~\ref{fig:CGLN1} we show, the distribution of amplitudes (see Sec.\ref{sec:CGLN}) at one particular pion production angle $\Theta^{CM}_{\pi^0}=60^{\circ}$ as a function of $W$.
The blue lines are results of the fit to world data and the red lines are solutions with our data included. The dashed lines are 
for imaginary parts of amplitudes. For the real part of amplitudes the blue (dashed-dotted) lines are results of the fit to previous 
data and red (solid) are results of the fit with our data included. Vertical arrows show positions of  $N^{*}$ resonances listed as 
$4^*$-resonances in PDG. As one can see, the main features of previous solution are preserved, however the
strength of different groups of resonances are affected and for some the contributions almost negligible, questioning their 
overall existence. 

Detailed amplitude analysis of the world data with the inclusion of our new data in entire kinematic range at all angles 
and invariant masses available will allow to constrain positions, Breit-Wigner widths and couplings of different resonances 
as well as dismiss and/or observe missing resonance states with high statistical confidence.

\subsubsection{$\chi^2$ Improvements}\label{sec:chi}
The measured cross-section presented in this analysis yielded an improvement to the SAID fit. This improvement, in the form of a $\chi^2/dp$, can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:chi_sq}, where the new cross-section measurement is depicted in red while the previous is depicted in blue. Decreasing the $\chi^2/dp$ reflects the ``goodness" of fit and overall quality of fitting the data. This is important because if a fit determines a resonance or change in amplitude, the quality of the fit determines the accuracy of the of the solution.

\subsection{Discussion of SAID Fits and Comaprision to World Data}\label{sec:discussion}
This measurement agrees with existing world data at low energy where there are numerous previous measurements. At higher energies there appears to be partial disagreement with~\cite{brem} in which this data was taken from untagged bremsstrahlung beam. This disagreement can be seen in some of the low angle $\theta$ excitation functions in Sec.~\ref{ExtFun}. However, with the same data presented in~\cite{brem} there is agreement, noticeably at angles $\theta = 89^\circ$ and $\theta = 92^\circ$. Since the excitation function measurements preformed in this analysis agree well in the low energy domain and also the data is congruent throughout the $\theta$ spectrum, further investigation is needed into the method of~\cite{brem} to understand where or why the discrepancy exists.

\subsection{Comparison with Theory}\label{Kroll}
The handbag model calculations by Kroll \textit{et al.}~\cite{Huang2000} does not agree with the present data as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:kroll}. There is no supporting material to explain why this model does not work well. Future models using Regge-parametrization are currently being formulated independently of this analysis. These high energy \piz cross-sections will be the basis for all future models.

\section{Conclusions}
This manuscript explained the procedure of collecting data in the \abbr{CLAS} detector for the \g12 experiment. Data corrections, kinematic fitting and fiducial cuts were used to clean the data to the order of $\approx$98\% signal. Differential cross-sections in two representation, $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$ and $\frac{d\sigma}{dt}$, were given along with comparisons to the existing world data, comparison existing Bonn-Gatchina fits and new SAID parameterization fits. The cross-sections measured in this analysis agreed well with the existing world data for low incident beam energies, while there was a slight discrepancy with the previous limited high energy cross-sections. The fits using the SAID parametrization yielded a $\chi^2/dp$ lower than previous existing fits. The data set explained in this analysis is now 10\% of the world data for \piz photoproduction. More theory is need to properly explain \piz production at incident photon beam energies higher than 2.8~GeV.
