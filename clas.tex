\chapter{\label{sec:clas}The \abbr{CLAS6} detector at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility }

The analysis performed in this work utilizes data collected during a run period from March 2008 - June 2008. The experiment designation was \g12  which was operated in the \abbr{CLAS6} detector\cite{clas} at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (\abbr{TJNAF}\label{abbr:tjnaf}) shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:jlab.aerial}, also known as Jefferson Laboratory (\abbr{JLab}\label{abbr:jlab}). The \abbr{CLAS6} detector is housed in hall \desg{B} at \abbr{JLab}. Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility\cite{cebaf}(\abbr{CEBAF}\label{abbr:cebaf}, Fig.~\ref{fig:jlab.cebaf}) is also housed on the \abbr{JLab} site. \abbr{CEBAF} provides a continuous electron beam to three halls \desg{A}, \desg{B} and \desg{C}. Each hall incorporates a particle detector of different characteristics. For this work the hall \desg{B} will \abbr{CLAS6} detector will be mentioned.

In Hall \desg{B} of \abbr{JLab}, the \abbr{CEBAF} Large Angle Spectrometer (\abbr{CLAS6}\label{abbr:clas}) is, in essence, a large acceptance multi-wire proportional drift-chamber (\abbr{DC}). The main purpose of the \abbr{DC} in conjunction with the toroidal magnetic field (see Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.dc}) is to measure the momentum of charged final-state particles that leave the target. For the most part, the rest of the \abbr{CLAS6} detector is used to obtain accurate timing and particle identification. In particular, a photon tagger, specific to Hall \desg{B} \emph{photon runs} as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.tagr}, is used to measure the energy of photons incident on the target. In addition, there are several beam intensity and dispersion measuring devices used as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:clas.beam}.

The \abbr{CLAS6} detector, shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:hall-b}, \ref{fig:clas} and \ref{fig:clas.ced}, consists of six segments in $\phi$ (angle about the beam line) called \emph{sectors}, each of which cover approximately $\frac{3}{4}\pi$~radians in $\theta$ (angle from beam line). Each of the six segments consists of a scintillator start counter (\abbr{ST}), three layers of drift chambers (\abbr{DC}), a gas \v{C}erenkov counter (\abbr{CC}), a series of scintillator ``time-of-flight'' (\abbr{TOF}) counters and an electromagnetic calorimeter (\abbr{EC}). There is a toroidal magnetic field concentrated in the middle \abbr{DC} layer which bends charged particles toward or away from the beam line. This field geometry forces the particles to trace a path lying on a plane which allows for a simplied reconstruction algorithm. However, an asymmetry in the acceptance of oppositely charged particles is created.

The beam, indicated by the red line, enters the hall from the lower right and passes through the tagger where the electrons are bent toward the beam dump in the floor and the photons continue to the target.}
